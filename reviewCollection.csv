"The Oasis Cafe","Mona Al-Kazemi","The vibes of this cafe are so uplifting! From the moment we entered, we were greeted with friendly smiles from someone who looks like the manager and the others, including Lexi, who was also generous with us. Christmas music and decorations made it feel so joyful - we were really happy to be there!\n\nLoved the fresh cream of the strawberry tres leches cake - very delicious!","5","a month ago"
"The Oasis Cafe","Ruwan J.","meant to write this review back in the summer.  stopped at Oasis Cafe for coffee a few times. stopped by here on sweltering summer days and Oasis had the best remedy--ice-cold iced Americano. nothing like medium roast coffee to cool you down when humidity and sun are combining to beat you up when you dare step outside. the cafe is very large. the summery beach vibed interior is really clean, modern, and upbeat. there's plenty of seats if you need a moment or two to collect your thoughts, have a conversation, or do some work. beyond the cafe's variety of drinks, there's a large variety of pastries, cakes, and more to satisfy those pangs of hunger...they are all on display from front to back. service is quick and friendly enough. Oasis Cafe is definitely  worth a stop by in any season as it has a great location on Avenue A and it is close enough to L if you have to head elsewhere.","4","a month ago"
"The Oasis Cafe","Carolina Vasquez","This store for me was something wonderful when they opened it I bought everything but when I say everything I mean everything I tried everything I was one of the happiest customers with this cafe the staff that served me at the beginning I give 10 out of 10 there is a young man who is the best actually I don't remember his name but he is the only man I have seen in the store until today who I think was the owner who was helping I don't know. But today I had the worst experience with a cr√®me br√ªl√©e it had an eggy flavor and smelled like egg it was missing a touch of salt I don't know what happened but the most horrible thing was that eggy flavor. On the other hand one of the girls at the store always has a super ugly face at the customers. The prices are very good and each dessert is delicious my experience is different every time I go.","3","4 months ago"
"The Oasis Cafe","Farnoosh","I had been to their other location on 9th Ave, but it was my first time trying this new location. I'm happy that they have more tables here and they don't mind people using laptops. We got flat white and baklava cheesecake and they were both good. They have so many other desserts I'd like to try. So, I'll definitely be going back.","5","2 months ago"

"The Oasis Cafe","Natasha","Hate to do this but I was craving dessert and ordered online got two tarts and banana pudding, both were terrible! The ‚Äúcream‚Äù on the tart tasted like nothing I‚Äôm not even sure what it is, and the banana pudding was more like banana oatmeal or something, not decadent and with a really bitter aftertaste. Was really hoping for some yummy dessert‚Ä¶","1","4 months ago"

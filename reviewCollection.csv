"A.M. Craft","nextdoorwarren","This has quickly become my favorite coffee shop in the South Bay. The staff is friendly, and the coffee beverages have been fantastic—when they use a bean I like, it ranks in my top 5 Bay Area lattes. To round things out, of the dozen or so …","5","5 months ago"
"A.M. Craft","Nadia Morozova","They can make upside down latte that's a plus! Coffee tastes pretty good. However, they served it in to go cups for some reasons (they didn't ask if we are staying or not), so no latte art for us... Number of tables can be increased as well inside and outside. Difficult to find parking.","4","6 months ago"
"A.M. Craft","Shruthi Sheshadri","Definitely one of the best lattes I've had. Very kind baristas- greeted with a big smile. I got a toasted Marshmallow latte which was really good.

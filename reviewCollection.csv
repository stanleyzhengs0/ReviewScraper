"St Kilda Coffee","Xin Hao","Nice little cafe located below the streets of Hell Kitchen - cosy, nice and warm. Staff is efficient and polite. Free flow water available. Limited seating capacity but works for small groups or individuals looking for a quick coffee fix while wandering through the streets of New York. Reasonably priced and quality is very decent! Superb alternative to Starbucks. Light bites and savory treats also available in a small mini bar section to go with your coffee. Highly recommended!","4","3 months ago"

The coffee they‚Äôre using is fresh and superb. More than anything else however, the atmosphere is so fun.

Everything about this restaurant was great, the food,  service and the ambience; but the only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 star is because I feel they can really add a few more vegetarian and vegan dishes.

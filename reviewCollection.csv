"Plowshares Coffee Bloomingdale","Camila Roriz","I come here practically every day; they have the best coffee. I always order a double cappuccino, and all pastries are delicious, especially the one with strawberry and cream. It is a small place, but people come and go, and you can always find a spot for yourself. At least that's what I do. ‚ù§Ô∏è","5","2 weeks ago"
